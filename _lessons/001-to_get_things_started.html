<h2>First assignment: Start to keep an online journal about everything you learned</h2>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Keeping a journal forces you to digest the presented content and summarize it for yourself.<br/>
        This reinforces the learning of the content.</li>
    <li>It also become a reference for yourself and other to look back at.</li>
    <li>It provides a nice starting point to talk about some fundamentals of the web like HTML, browers and hosting</li>
</ol>

<h3>Approach</h3>

<p>
    I did not want to teach them just some programming language, I wanted them to get used to some best practices
    right a way. So the first assignment had to be about getting up and running with some kind of Version Control
    an of course GIT was the most logical option.
</p>

<p>
    This allowed us to use  <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> for hosting the online journals.
</p>
