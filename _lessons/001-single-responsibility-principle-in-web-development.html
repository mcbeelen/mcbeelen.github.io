    title: Single Responsibility Principle in Web Development
---


<h2>Lesson number: ONE</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
    Of course the very first lesson has to be related to the number one.<br />
    Although I will interpret it loosely into <em>single</em> and <em>once</em>.
</p>

<p>
    There are two principles know in the field of Software Engineering, both of whom are very beneficial in managing
    any kind of software system in a simple and powerful way.<br />
    These are:

    <ul>

        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself">DRY: Don't repeat yourself</a></li>
    </ul>


<h3>Single Responsibility Principle</h3>

<blockquote>
    The <strong>single responsibility principle</strong> states that every piece of a system (file, module or class)
    should have responsibility over a <strong>single part</strong> of the functionality provided by the software,<br />
    and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Some rules:
    <ul>
        <li>Every single piece of the system should have a <strong>just one single purpose</strong>.</li>
        <li>
            If several aspects apply to a certain area of a system, those different aspects should be implemented in seperate
            pieces: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">Separation of concerns</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Web Development</h4>

<p>
    When developing for the web there are three techniques to comprehend for the three main aspects of a web page:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>HTML</strong> to determine <em>WHAT</em> should be shown on the page: The content</li>
        <li><strong>CSS</strong> to determine <em>HOW</em> it should be shown on the page: The layout</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> to add <em>INTERACTION</em> to the page: The layout</li>
    </ol>

    The first important this to learn is to keep all layout related information from the HTML.<br />

</p>


<h5>HTML</h5>

<p>
    Any HTML-file contains the content to show on screen, where all elements are enclosed in <em>tags</em>.
    Those tags adds a structure to the document and thereby inform any browser how to interpret the document.<br />
    Without any guidelines on HOW to render that document (CSS), all browsers have a default way on
    how to render a document and that will be largely dependent on which tags are found in the document. Some examples:
</p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>&lt;p&gt;</dt>
            <dd>Paragraph of text</dd>
        <dt>&lt;ul&gt;</dt>
            <dd>Unordered List/dd>
        <dt>&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, ..., &lt;h7&gt;</dt>
            <dd>Headers in various sizes</dd>
        <dt>&lt;division&gt;</dt>
            <dd>Division (of section)</dd>
        <dt>&lt;nav&gt;</dt>
            <dd>Navigation block</dd>
    </dl>
<p>
    These are just a subset of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">a list of available tags</a>.<br />

</p>

<p>
    After years of web development some best practices have emerged on when to use certain tags
    and how to apply styling to them: <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a><br />
    When you start writing HTML, stick to the Fundamental HTML elements tags mentioned in the documentations of
    Bootstraps<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/base-css.html">Base CSS</a><br />
    <small>Note: That documentation is based upon the outdated version 2 of Bootstrap, but is still useful and valid
    for the HTML-tags in newer versions.</small>
