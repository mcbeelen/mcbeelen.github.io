        <h1>Software Apprenticeship: <em>Class of 2016</em></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    While talking with <a href="http://simonekamer.github.io/">Simone Kamer</a> about a career switch I started to think
    about things to teach somebody new to the profession of a Software Engineer.<br/>
    She was interested to learn and I'm enthousiastic about teaching and coaching, so a Software Apprenticeship was
    the logical next step.<br />
</p>

<p>
    When the Software Apprenticeship really started I wondered if my brother-in-law
    <a href="https:/shmvanhouten.github.io">Sjoerd van Houten</a> might be interested as well.
    One text message later the <em>class of 2016</em>> had it's second student.
</p>

<h2>Approach</h2>
<p>
    We agreed to meet one evening each week, where I would explain some stuff related to software engineering
    and practice something together<br/>
    On November 22nd of 2016 we started with <a href="/lessons.html">our lessons</a><br />
    After each lesson they got some homework as well to try it on their own and expand their knowledge and learning.
</p>

<h2>Keeping track</h2>

<p>
    Initially I hoped to keep track of all lessons and topics, which I taught my students.<br/>
    Unfortunately preparations for the lessons, the evenings themselves and my normal job and live,
    prevented my from doing that properly.
</p>
