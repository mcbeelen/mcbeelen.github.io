                    I am <em>Software Crafter</em>, with a passion for maintainable and readable code.<br/>
                    Prior to starting to work as a software developer in 2005,
                    I was a system administrator, which instilled the importance of observability of software systems.

                    Marco is married and the father of two children. He prefers” Drink you own Champagne” over “Eat your
                    own dogfood” especially since he likes to drink Champagne.
                    If you want to get in touch, he can be found online as @mcbeelen
