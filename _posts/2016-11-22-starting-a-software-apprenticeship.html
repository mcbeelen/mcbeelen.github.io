<h1>Software Apprenticeship</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    While talking with <a href="http://simonekamer.github.io/">Simone Kamer</a> about a career switch I started to think
    about things to teach somebody new to the profession of a Software Engineer.<br/>
    She was interested to learn and I'm enthousiastic about teaching and coaching, so a Software Apprenticeship was
    the logical next step.<br />
</p>

<p>
    When the Software Apprenticeship really started I wondered if my brother-in-law
    <a href="https:/shmvanhouten.github.io">Sjoerd van Houten</a> might be interested as well.
    One text message later the <em>class of 2016</em>> had it's second student.

<p>
    On November 22nd of 2016 we started with <a href="/lessons/001-to_get_things_started.html">our first lesson</a><br />
