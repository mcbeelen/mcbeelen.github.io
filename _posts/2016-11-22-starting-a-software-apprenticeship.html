<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    While talking with <a href="http://simonekamer.github.io/">Simone Kamer</a> about a career switch I started to think
    about things to teach somebody new to the profession of a Software Engineer.<br/>
    She was interested to learn and I'm enthousiastic about teaching and coaching, so a Software Apprenticeship was
    the logical next step.<br />
</p>

<p>
    When the Software Apprenticeship really started I wondered if my brother-in-law
    <a href="https:/shmvanhouten.github.io">Sjoerd van Houten</a> might be interested as well.
    One text message later the 'class of 2016' had it's second student.

<h2>First assignment: Version Control</h2>

<p>
    I did not want to teach them just some programming language, I wanted them to get used to some best practices
    right a way. So the first assignment had to be about getting up and running with some kind of Version Control
    an of course GIT was the most logical option.
</p>

<p>
    The assignment was:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Find a professional username, which isn't used on github.com and create an account for yourself<br/>
            Availability of the same username of <a href="https:twitter.com">Twitter</a> was recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start to keep a journal on our individual <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>
        </li>
    </ol>
