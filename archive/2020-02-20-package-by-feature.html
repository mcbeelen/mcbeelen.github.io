<h2>Package-by-Feature with the Default Access Modifier.</h2>

<p>
    A lot of business applications are written using a three-tier architecture: View, Business, and Data layers,
    and all model objects are used by all three layers.
    In some codebases, the classes for these applications are organized by layer.
    In some application, which have the need to register various users and the company they work for, the code structure would result in something like:
</p>

<pre>
    tld.domain.project.model.Company
    tld.domain.project.model.User
    tld.domain.project.controllers.CompanyController
    tld.domain.project.controllers.UserController
    tld.domain.project.storage.CompanyRepository
    tld.domain.project.storage.UserRepository
    tld.domain.project.service.CompanyService
    tld.domain.project.service.UserService
</pre>

<p>
    Using such a <em>package-by-layer</em> structure for your classes requires a lot of methods to be public.
    The <code>UserService</code> needs to be able to read and write Users into storage and,
    since the <code>UserRepository</code> is in another package,
    almost all methods of the <code>UserRepository</code> would need to be public.
</p>

<p>
    The organization might have a policy to send an email to a user, to notify them when their password has been changed.
    Such a policy might be implemented in the <code>UserService</code>.
    Since the methods in the <code>UserRepository</code> are public,
    there is no protection against another part of the application invoking a method in <code>UserRepository</code>,
    which changes the password but does not trigger the notification to be sent.
</p>
<p>
    When this application is updated to include some customer-care module or a web-care interface,
    some of the features in those modules might want to reset the password.
    Since these features are built at a later point in time, perhaps after new developers have joined the team,
    these developers might be tempted to access the <code>UserRepository</code>
    directly from a <code>CustomerCareService</code> instead of calling the <code>UserService</code> and triggering the notification.
</p>

<p>
    The Java language provides a mechanism to prevent this: <strong>access modifiers</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The default access modifier means we do not explicitly declare an access modifier for a class, field, method, etc.
A variable or method declared without any access control modifier is available only to other classes in the same package.
This is also called <em>package-private</em>.
</p>
<p>
    In order to benefit from that access protection mechanism,
    the code base should be organized into a package-by-feature package hierarchy.
    The same classes as before would be packaged like this:
</p>
<pre>
    tld.domain.project.company.Company
    tld.domain.project.company.CompanyController
    tld.domain.project.company.CompanyService
    tld.domain.project.company.CompanyRepository
    tld.domain.project.user.User
    tld.domain.project.user.UserController
    tld.domain.project.user.UserService
    tld.domain.project.user.UserRepository
</pre>

<p>
    When organized like this, none of the methods in the <code>UserRepository</code> would have to be public.
    They all could be package-private and still be available to the <code>UserService</code>.
    The methods of the <code>UserService</code> could be made public.
</p>
<p>
    Any developer building the <code>CustomerCareService</code>, in the package <code>tld.domain.project.support</code>,
    would <strong>not</strong> be able to invoke methods on the <code>UserRepository</code>
    and should call the methods of the <code>UserService</code>.
    This way the code structure and the access modifiers help to ensure 
    that the application still adheres to the policy to send the notification.
</p>

<p>
    This strategy for organizing the classes in your codebase will help reduce the coupling in your codebase.
