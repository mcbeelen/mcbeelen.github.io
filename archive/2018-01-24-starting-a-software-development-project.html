title: Starting a Software Development Project

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>
    A bit more then a year after the Software Apprenticeship started, we covered a lot of <a href="/lessons.html">topics</a>.<br />
    But still a major topic was missing: How to use that (theoretical) knowledge for building a working Software Solution.<br/>
    Luckily we caught a break: A friend challenged us to build an App to help her in doing some boring recurring administrative work.
    This was an nice opportunity to explain and experience how a Software Project gets started.
</p>

<h2>Important questions first</h2>

<p>
    When a project gets started there are usually a lot of unknowns and questions, which needs answers.
    All or most of them needs to be addressed, but not all of them have the same priority and a very interesting
    aspect about all these questions is: How do we keep track of the questions and answers.<br />

</p>

<dl>
    <dt>How are we going to call this project?</dt>
    <dd>
        Once something has a name it becomes a identity and we can speak more easily about it, so naming this is important,
        but naming things is hard and it's best done as a <a href="http://arlobelshee.com/good-naming-is-a-process-not-a-single-step/">process</a>.<br />
        Eventually things like marketing, branding, availability of a domain name and availability on Social Media become important, but not just yet.<br />
        So start with some 'internal project name' and don't worry about the rest yet.<br />
        Suggestions for codenames:
        <ul>
            <li>Combine some word of the address of the client from what three words<a href="https://map.what3words.com"></a></li>
            <li>Some <a href="https://codepen.io/mikedryan/details/vLrgqr">random generated name like docker containers</a></li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>In which language are we going to write the documentation / Software Architecture Document</dt>
    <dd>
        The short answer: Use English!<br />
        The longer answer: For our project we want to have a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">'Ubiquitous Language'</a>
        All stakeholders and participants in the project should be able to communicate about project and should not be hindered by
        their capacity to speak / write in the language used in the Ubiquitous Language. So under some conditions perhaps you should switch
        to the native language of you product owner.
    </dd>

    <dt>Where are we going to store the documentation?</dt>
    <dd>
        Documentation should be under version control as well!<br/>
        So logical places for documentation are:
        <ul>
            <li>A markdown in GIT</li>
            <li>Some wiki with History / Version Control</li>
            <li>Word with track changes</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>


<h2>What are we going to document?</h2>

<p>
    Fortunately there are some good model available to identify what needs to be investigated and documented related to a Software Product.<br/>
    I prefer to write a Software Architecture Document based upon
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">'4+1 Architectural View Model'</a><br >
    This structure help me to answer the following questions:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>What are we going to build?</dt>
    <dd>
        In order to get an general impression what the system is going to do, I find it useful to draw a 'System Landscape Diagram', which
        show and identifies the actors, the other software systems involved and their relationship to the 'Software System'.<br />
        A 'System Landscape Diagram' is one of the <a href="https://c4model.com/#coreDiagrams">Core diagrams of the C4 Model</a><br />
        <br />


        The <em>Scenario's'</em> should be written as <a href="http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html">feature files using Gherkin</a>,
        so that they can be reused for automatic tests using <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a><br />
        If a more detailed / formal documentation is needed for features, you could look at
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Use-case-description-for-add-comment_277999085">'Use Case Descriptions'</a> although
        they are a bit out of fashion.
    </dd>

    <dt>How are we going to build this project?</dt>
    <dd>
        The <em>Development view</em> should give answer to the following questions:
        Where are going to store the project code?<br/>
        In which language are we going to develop this project?<br />
        Which frameworks are we going to use?<br />
        How do we test, build, deploy the project?<br />
        How do we track our bugs, features, improvements?<br />
        <br />
        This could be written down as a seperate chapter of the SAD or in the README.md of the project.
    </dd>

    <dt>What is the structure of the appliation?</dt>
    <dd>
        This is a combination of the <em>Logical View</em> with information like a <strong>Entity-Relationship-Diagram</strong> or <strong>database schema</strong>
        and <em>Process View</em> with <strong>Sequence Diagrams</strong>, <strong>State Diagrams</strong> and <strong>Activity Diagrams</strong>
    </dd>

    <dt>How does the application get deployed in various environments?</dt>
    <dd>
        A <em>Physical View</em> with a deployment diagram.<br >
        A 'Container Diagram' from the <a href="https://c4model.com/">C4 Model</a> works pretty good for this!
    </dd>

<h3>Ubiquitous Language</h3>

<p>
    As mentioned before: Each project should use a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">'Ubiquitous Language'</a><br />
    In order to make adoption of the Ubiquitous Language for the project as easy as possible, the project team should
    create a <strong>Glossary</strong>, which identifies all key terms or concepts and adds a description to the clarify if needed.
